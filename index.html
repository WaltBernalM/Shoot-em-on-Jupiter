          <h2>What am I seeing?</h2>
          <p>
            You’re behaving the epitome of a 2D Hunting Duck experience with a 3D behavior, that’s catchy. 
            <br><br>
            Well, you’re like seeing to a room, or a box, you’re seeing that depth effect... 
            <br>
            You have plenty of information, some may need you to think a bit more about what the hell is that.
            <br>
            You’ll experience the behavior of the parabolic shot while you try to kill those poor 8bit b*stards ducks.
            <br><br>
            In order to pass to the next level or world, you’ll have to kill 3 ducks...Good luck with that, the creator did his best mark around level 25, it’s hell difficult!

          <h2>Why my shot is not moving straight forward?</h2>
          <p>
            Because you’re not playing DH from our beloved NES... 
            <br>
            Just kidding, but this is no lie.
            <br><br>
            Here comes some physiscs concepts that you had to deal with at highschoool:
            <br>
            What you’re experiencing the effects of wind and gravity against you and your bullet. 
            <br>
            That’s why you should be perceptive on what the screen is showing to you. 
            <br>I broke my back to give you this experience dude, come on... be more intuitive.
